For this article you should focus on the findings reported for Experiment 1 in section 2.2. Results and discussion. Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> Reaction times (RTs) for correct responses for each ordinal position of an item within the presented theme, collapsed across the three presentations, are presented in Fig. 1 (see also Table 1). A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factors ordinal position (5) and presentation (3) with participants (F1) and themes (F2) as random variables (cf. Belke and Stielow, 2013 and Howard et al., 2006) revealed a main effects of presentation (F1(2, 46) = 54, p < .001, View the MathML source = .70; F2(2, 30) = 130.6, p < .001, View the MathML source = .89) and ordinal position (F1(4, 92) = 11.1, p < .001, View the MathML source = .33; F2(4, 60) = 7.0, p < .001, View the MathML source = .32). There was no interaction between presentation and ordinal position, Fs < 1.7. For the ordinal position effect, there was a significant linear trend, F1(1, 23) = 36.6, p < .001, View the MathML source = .62; F2(1, 15) = 19.1, p < .001, View the MathML source = .56, indicating that RTs increased linearly with each ordinal position.

> An ANOVA of mean error rates revealed a main effect of presentation (F1 (2, 46) = 26, p < .001, View the MathML source = .53; F2(1, 30) = 30.2, p < .001, View the MathML source = .66) that reflects a decrease in errors between the first and later presentations (cf. Table 1). No other effects were found, Fs < 0.8.
